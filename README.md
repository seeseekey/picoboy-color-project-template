# Project template for Picoboy

This template is intended as a starting point for developing your own firmware based on the Picoboy. It's based on [
rp2040-project-template](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp2040-project-template).

It includes all of the `knurling-rs` tooling as showcased in https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template (`defmt`, `defmt-rtt`, `panic-probe`, `flip-link`) to make development as easy as possible.

`elf2uf2-rs` is configured as the default runner, so you can start your program as easy as

```sh
cargo run --release
```

## Requirements
  
* The standard Rust tooling (cargo, rustup) which you can install from https://rustup.rs/
* Toolchain support for the cortex-m0+ processors in the rp2040 (thumbv6m-none-eabi)
* flip-link - this allows you to detect stack-overflows on the first core, which is the only supported target for now.

## Installation of development dependencies

```sh
rustup target install thumbv6m-none-eabi

cargo install flip-link

# Installs the elf2uf2-rs runner
cargo install --locked elf2uf2-rs
```

## Use cargo generate

You can create a new project with cargo-generate. First install it:

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate
```

Then you can create a new project from the template:

```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/seeseekey/picoboy-project-template.git
```

## Running
  
For a debug build
```sh
cargo run
```
For a release build
```sh
cargo run --release
```

If you do not specify a DEFMT_LOG level, it will be set to `debug`.
That means `println!("")`, `info!("")` and `debug!("")` statements will be printed.
If you wish to override this, you can change it in `.cargo/config.toml` 
```toml
[env]
DEFMT_LOG = "off"
```
You can also set this inline (on Linux/MacOS)  
```sh
DEFMT_LOG=trace cargo run
```

or set the _environment variable_ so that it applies to every `cargo run` call that follows:
#### Linux/MacOS/unix
```sh
export DEFMT_LOG=trace
```

Setting the DEFMT_LOG level for the current session  
for bash
```sh
export DEFMT_LOG=trace
```

#### Windows
Windows users can only override DEFMT_LOG through `config.toml`
or by setting the environment variable as a separate step before calling `cargo run`
- cmd
```cmd
set DEFMT_LOG=trace
```
- powershell
```ps1
$Env:DEFMT_LOG = trace
```

```cmd
cargo run
```

## Notes on using rp2040_hal and rp2040_boot2

  The second-stage boot loader must be written to the .boot2 section. That
  is usually handled by the board support package (e.g.`rp-pico`). If you don't use
  one, you should initialize the boot loader manually. This can be done by adding the
  following to the beginning of main.rs:
  ```rust
  use rp2040_boot2;
  #[link_section = ".boot2"]
  #[used]
  pub static BOOT_LOADER: [u8; 256] = rp2040_boot2::BOOT_LOADER_W25Q080;
  ```

## Feature flags

  There are several [feature flags in rp2040-hal](https://docs.rs/rp2040-hal/latest/rp2040_hal/#crate-features).
  If you want to enable some of them, uncomment the `rp2040-hal` dependency in `Cargo.toml` and add the
  desired feature flags there. For example, to enable ROM functions for f64 math using the feature `rom-v2-intrinsics`:
  ```
  rp2040-hal = { version="0.10", features=["rt", "critical-section-impl", "rom-v2-intrinsics"] }
  ```
